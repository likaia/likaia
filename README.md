**Company project experience:**

I am mainly responsible for the development and optimization of the core module of the web-side animation editor in the company. Some of the main achievements are:：
* Integrate the analysis of materials in apng format, and write a set of apng-to-canvas library (support playback control and specified frame jump)
* Implement the search function of the svg text component in the canvas, and solve the problem that the browser does not support the search for svg text type elements by default
* Implemented the function of exporting draft content in the editor to PDF to support users' printing needs
* Responsible for the architecture design and development of a set of node middle-tier services that modify the draft content through the API within the company (using nest for implementation)
